# LegBreaksReduced

Just a simple math.round upon damage that would otherwise break legs. This is compared to the value within `LegBreakCfg.c` and when below that value legs will break as normal, if above they won't.

Percentage change of leg breaking can be adjusted in `LegBreakCfg.c`
under the value: `float chanceOfLegBreak`.

Hell knows if this is really the correct way to do it, but fact is it does the job.
